        The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
        Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Lee and Ditko conceived the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May 
        and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence in addition to those of a costumed crime-fighter. 
        Spider-Mans creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted 
        devices of his own invention, which he calls "web-shooters", 
        and react to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat his foes</p>';
